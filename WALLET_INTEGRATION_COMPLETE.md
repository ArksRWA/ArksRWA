## Summary

The ARKS RWA application now fully supports wallet-based trading with:

✅ **Real ICP Transactions**: Actual blockchain payments using ICP
✅ **Wallet Integration**: Full support for Plug and Internet Identity wallets
✅ **Cost Transparency**: Clear ICP cost display for all transactions
✅ **Payment Flows**: Proper wallet payment confirmation and error handling
✅ **User Experience**: Clear distinction between demo and real wallet modes
✅ **Security**: Proper wallet validation and transaction verification
✅ **UI/UX**: Wallet-focused interface design throughout the application

The platform is now ready for real-world use with actual ICP wallet transactions, providing users with a true blockchain-based asset trading experience.

## Final Fix Applied

### Deprecated Function Elimination
- **Issue**: Backend was still receiving calls to deprecated `buyTokens()` and `sellTokens()` functions
- **Solution**: Updated demo mode paths to use new wallet-based functions:
  - `buyTokens()` → `buyTokensWithICP()` with block index 0 for demo mode
  - `sellTokens()` → `sellTokensForICP()` with block index 0 for demo mode
- **Result**: All deprecated function warnings eliminated, consistent API usage across all modes

### Code Quality Improvements
- **Removed Unused Parameter**: Fixed `sellTokensForICP()` method signature by removing unused `p0` parameter
- **Updated Function Calls**: Corrected all call sites to match the updated function signature
- **Consistent Interface**: All backend service methods now have clean, purposeful parameter lists

### Verification Complete
✅ **No Deprecated Functions**: Confirmed zero usage of legacy `buyTokens()` and `sellTokens()` functions
✅ **Consistent API**: Both demo and real wallet modes now use the same backend functions
✅ **Clean Warnings**: Backend deprecation warnings eliminated
✅ **Unified Experience**: Seamless transition between demo and real wallet modes
✅ **Clean Function Signatures**: Removed unused parameters for better code quality
✅ **Consistent Function Calls**: All call sites updated to match corrected signatures
